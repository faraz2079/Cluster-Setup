This repo is for Initializing K8s cluster on various machines automated. 
please give the script previlige to run first:

`chmod +x clustersetup.sh`

There are 2 versions:
- One which finds the ip and interface of the machine and place them in the required field and runs the script and eventually initializes the cluster
- Another which you specify the variables at the beginning and then run the script so it does the rest.

And the run the script like: 

`./clustersetup.sh`
